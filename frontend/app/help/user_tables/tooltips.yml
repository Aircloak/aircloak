# The tooltips are structured in the following way:
#
#   tool_tip_name1:
#     content: tooltip
#   tool_tip_name2:
#     content: |
#       Multiline markdown
#       ==hurray==
#     placement: top | bottom | left | right (default: bottom)
#     markdown: true (default: false)

in_cluster:
  content: |
    When creating a new table you are able to choose which cluster the table
    should be created in.

    Only tasks running on the cluster the table is on
    will have access to the data in it.
    It is __not possible to migrate__ a table from one cluster to another.
  markdown: true
row_expiry:
  content: |
    Number of days after which an inserted row will be removed from the table.
    If left empty, rows will never be removed.
  markdown: true
column_form_constraints:
  content: |
    When set, the `NOT NULL`-constraint will have a cloak cluster
    reject input data where a particular column is missing.

    It provides consistent data, potentially at the cost of
    rejecting _nearly_ perfect data.
