  # Managing data

  Inside a cloak cluster, your data is stored in a distributed and replicated Postgres database instance.
  Before uploading data to a cluster, you need to create tables to hold the data.

  To provide the highest level of privacy, entities of your tables should always correspond to the data you are
  trying to protect. Most often, this data will be about real people whose private data should not leak outside
  of the cloak system. Each row of all your tables correspond directly to a single user, and the id
  of this row identifies that particular user. Of course, it is perfectly fine to have multiple rows for
  the same users.

  Moreover, the data in your table should not be related to another user. Otherwise, a malicious query writer
  has an option of reporting multiple counts per individual user, and can in this way obtain some knowledge
  about the individual user.

  For example, let us say you track geolocations of people at a university, and want to record meetings between
  various university disciplines. One way to approach this problem is to introduce a table `meetings` where
  you would keep a column `other_user` which contains an id of the user that participated in the meeting.
  This introduces a potential privacy vulnerability, because now it is possible to report multiple counts per
  that "other" user. For example, if a malicious query writer knows some part of the meeting schedule of a
  certain person, he could construct a query which filters such meetings and reports a user id. This makes it
  possible to obtain the id of the user. Having an id, the query writer could then easily filter out the rest
  of the user's meeting schedule.

  As a remedy for this problem, instead of storing other user's id, you could just store the user's discipline.
  Note though that this is not 100% safe either. If there are "small" disciplines, with only a few people, the
  discipline column can be almost as revealing as the user id.

  So as a general rule, you should try to keep the table rows focused on a single user, with each column
  describing some property of that particular user. In case you need to break this rule, try to use as few
  columns as possible, make sure you fully understand the privacy implications of your design, and be sure
  that those other columns (which correspond to other users) cannot be misused to reveal particular individuals.


  ## Tables and clusters

  Database tables only live in a single cluster and cannot be migrated from one cluster to another.
  This applies both to the database definitions themselves, as well as the data in the tables.


  ## Naming

  Most any table and column name that is allowed by Postgres is also allowed in a cloak.
  More concretely, the following restrictions are enforced:

  - a table name can contain the characters `a` through `z` (in upper as well as lower case), and the numbers `0`
    through `9` as well as contain underscores (`_`)
  - a table name has to start with a character
  - a table or column name cannot start with `ac_`. This prefix is reserved for Aircloak internal tables and columns.


  ## Data types

  We support the following Postgres datatypes:

  - integer: signed 4 byte integer which can range from -2147483648 to +2147483647
  - bigint: signed 8 byte integer which can range from -9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807
  - float: 4 byte single precision floating-point number
  - double: 8 byte double precision floating-point number
  - boolean: logical true or false
  - varchar: variable length bounded character string
  - text: variable length unbounded character string (availability depends on the version of your cluster)


  ## Uploading data

  We provide HTTPS APIs for uploading data into cloaks.
  For more specifics about the APIs, please consult the
  <%= site_link "/apidocs/index.html", "API docs" %>.

  It is not important which of your cloak server you upload data to.
  A full URL for the _bulk insert_ API might therefore look like `https://<%= sample_cloak_name %>/bulk_insert`.

  It is authenticated using
  client certificates. For more information about authentication, please have a look
  at the <%= site_link "/apidocs/index.html#authentication", "authentication" %> section
  of our API docs

  __Please note:__
  In order to be able to upload data to your cloak, you will need to create some database tables first.
  You can do this at the <%= site_link controller.user_tables_path, "tables page" %>.
