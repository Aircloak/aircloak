  # Getting started

  In these help guides you will find a short set of guides to
  help you get started with the Aircloak analytics system.
  The guides cover the main aspects of our system, and what you need
  to know to get started using our system.


  ## Please ask for help

  The cloaked analytics system is a quite complex machinery.
  It can be a daunting task to get started. Please do not
  hesitate to reach out to the Airclaok team
  (support@aircloak.com) if you get stuck,
  or want ideas for how to solve problems in the context
  of our system, please let us know.


  ## How to read

  The guides cover everything from how you put sensitive data into a cloak, to how you
  write queries in order to get anonymized results back out.

  I recommend you start by reading the <%= help_link "introduction-uploading-data" %>, and follow
  that with reading the <%= help_link "introduction-queries" %>.

  Once you have a general understanding of how the components fit together, you can
  read the more detailed guides as you need them.

  The <%= site_link "/apidocs/index.html", "API Docs" %> will also be useful
  when you start uploading data of your own.
