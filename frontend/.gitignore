# See http://help.github.com/ignore-files/ for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal
# The schema differs depending on which environment you are in,
# it shouldn't be part of the git repo
/db/schema.rb

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*.log

# the original file is overwritten.
# When terminating the setup, we restore

# which is replaced is moved to
# config/database.yml-docker in case the launch
# failed, and this is in fact the original one.
