The canonical implementation of `WeakMap` exists in the Google Caja
Subversion repository at http://google-caja.googlecode.com/svn/trunk.
It was written by Mark S. Miller.  It is released by Google with the
Apache 2.0 license.  This package is maintained by Kris Kowal.

This work began with [Mark Miller’s proposal][Proposal] for `WeakMap` to ECMA’s
TC-39, where the JavaScript standard is developed.
