# The tooltips are structured in the following way:
#
#   tool_tip_name1:
#     content: tooltip
#   tool_tip_name2:
#     content: |
#       Multiline markdown
#       ==hurray==
#     placement: top | bottom | left | right (default: bottom)
#     markdown: true (default: false)

key_type:
  markdown: true
  content: |
    There are three key types supported:

    - data upload keys
    - administrative keys
    - keys for running tasks

    The __data upload__ key allows you to upload
    data about any users of your system.

    The __administrative__ keys allow you to perform
    potentially hazardous tasks like changing table
    definitions. These should be kept very safe.

    The __keys for runnning tasks__ allow you to execute
    a task against your cluster. These keys can be exported
    and included as part of a dashboard.
