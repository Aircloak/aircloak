        and fast attestation requests, and\nevery now and then also throws in some
        random\nrequests which are not syntactically valid.\n\nThere is a nasty racecondition
        happening when\nstrong requests are scheduled to closely to\neach other. This
        race conditions happens in the\ntest, but there is no evidence (as far as
        I am\nconcerned) regarding this being an actual issue\nin the server implementation
        itself.\nI allow for up to 2% of the test runs to have the\nrace condition.
        If the threshold is exceeded\nthe test fails.\n\nWe also fix a basic bug that
        made concurrent\nattestation requests fail.\n\nThere was a silly function
        match clause missing\n(I can even remember removing it) which prevented\nmultiple
        concurrent attestations from taking place.\n\nThis has been remedied and an
        additional unit test has\nbeen added to ensure that we allow transitions from\nfast

        parallel PropEr test\n\nThe test executes a whole bunch of parallel\nstrong

        happening when\nstrong requests are scheduled to closely to\neach other. This
        race conditions happens in the\ntest, but there is no evidence (as far as
        I am\nconcerned) regarding this being an actual issue\nin the server implementation
        itself.\nI allow for up to 2% of the test runs to have the\nrace condition.
        If the threshold is exceeded\nthe test fails.\n\nWe also fix a basic bug that
        made concurrent\nattestation requests fail.\n\nThere was a silly function
        match clause missing\n(I can even remember removing it) which prevented\nmultiple
        concurrent attestations from taking place.\n\nThis has been remedied and an
        additional unit test has\nbeen added to ensure that we allow transitions from\nfast
