# Central

`central` is an Aircloak hosted application used for management of customers,
recording of Aircloak usage for billing purpose, as well as for collecting usage
information for analytics purposes.

## What it does

This repository contains the Central system, which provides HTTPS endpoints that allows Aircloak
to perform various tasks, such as:

- Manage customers and their tokens
- See the number of queries executed by customers, along with which features were used

This application provides an websocket API that is used by the `air` applications installed
on customer premises.


## What is it made up of

The `central` is written as a single [elixir](elixir-lang.org/) [phoenix](www.phoenixframework.org) website.

Additionally to run it relies on `Postgres` for datastorage.


## Getting started

### Prerequisites

In order to run the system you need the following components:

- Node.js 5 or newer
- Erlang and Elixir (see [here](../README.md#prerequisites) for details)
- Docker 1.11 (+ [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) if on macOS)

Once you have all the main components, you also need the elixir and node.js dependencies required by our
application. Node.js is included to compile our javascript and css dependencies.

- `mix deps.get` installs our elixir and erlang dependencies
- `npm install` installs our node dependencies

Before you run the application for the first time, you also need to make sure you initialize the database
with `make recreate_db`
(make sure that [required common components are started](../README.md#starting-the-required-components)).


### Running

First, make sure the dependencies are started by running `../start_dependencies.sh`.
To start the development server, you run: `make start`.
Now you can access the site at http://localhost:7080/.

Note that there's no need to migrate the database. This will happen automatically when the application starts.
However, if you do need to manually migrate/rollback (for example while creating a new migration), you can do
it with `make migrate` and `make rollback` respectively.

If you need to repopulate the database, you can run `make recreate_db`. Keep in mind that this will erase all
of your existing data, so use with caution. To recreate the test database, you can run `MIX_ENV=test make recreate_db`

#### HTTPS endpoint

The site also accepts HTTPS requests on port 7443. Self-signed certificates are provided for the site central.air-local, meaning you need to add `/etc/hosts` entry which points this hostname to 127.0.0.1. You'll also need to import the certificate (located in `./priv/config/ssl_cert.pem`) into your browser. Once all is setup, you can access the site over HTTPS at https://central.air-local:7443.

### Local docker container

To start a local docker container, you need to first build the image with `./build-image.sh`. Then you can start the container with `./container.sh console`. Once the container is started you can access it at http://localhost:7080/ and https://insights.air-local:7443. Since different ports are used, the container can run side-by-side to the local site.

__Linux developers__: Scripts in this project use docker in the context of the logged in user (without root
privileges). To enable this, you need to add yourself to the `docker` group. See
[here](http://askubuntu.com/a/477554) for explanation.

__macOS users__: see [here](../macos_docker.md) for additional instructions.

### Other common tasks

- tests: `make test`
- `mix coveralls.html` - runs ExUnit tests with test coverage (generates an HTML output in the `cover` folder)
- dialyzer: `make dialyze`
- documentation: `make docs`
- lint: `make lint`
- building a release: `make release`

### Deploying

To deploy `central`, run the command `./production.sh <target> deploy` from the `central` root folder.

There are two deployment targets available. `central_prod` and `central_stage`. These deploy to
[https://central.aircloak.com](https://central.aircloak.com) and
[https://central-stage.aircloak.com](https://central-stage.aircloak.com) respectively.

If you want to change aspects of the deployment you can find the deployment configurations in the
[deploy_targets](../deploy_targets) folder alongside the configurations for the `aircloak` deployments.

Please note that all deployed aircloaks talk to the production central by default. That is by design.
To exercise the stage central, you have to visit [https://air-for-central-stage.aircloak.com](https://air-for-central-stage.aircloak.com)
which can be deployed like any other `aircloak` and relies on the deployment target `for_central_stage`.

### Kibana and Elasticsearch

The `central` application forwards stats to Elasticsearch. To work with Elasticsearch locally, install
and run Elasticsearch under the regular Elasticsearch port: `9200`.

Kibana is used to generate the dashboards shown in the `central` application.
`central` proxies requests under the path `/kibana` to the Kibana installation. For this to work locally
you need to configure your local Kibana with `server.basePath: '/kibana'`.

When generating new dashboards that should be embedded in the `central` site, you can use the following steps:

- create dashboard in Kibana
- set it up to auto-update
- select share, and copy the src URL used in the iframe option under "Share saved dashboard"
- use the part from (and including) `app/kibana#/dashboard` when configuring the application
