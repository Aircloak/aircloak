To run the tool locally, you need to install go with `asdf install`.

You first need to configure the tool, as explained in `user_guide.md`. Then, you can start it with `go run batch_queries.go`.

To build binaries, simply invoke `make` from this folder. The binaries for MacOS and Windows will be produced in the `_build` folder.
