    # This is the most important line in this migration:
    # - a previous version of the Kia database yielded UTF-16 characters,
    #   which resulted in a lot of \u0000 characters being present in
    #   the results. These are not supported by Postgres in the case of
    #   one wanting to extract data from the text as JSON...
    # - experiments on the databases show that doing a regexp replace on
    #   the field, replacing \u0000 with '' will yield good results
    # - this should not be a problem again in the immediate future, as
    #   the MS SQL adapter now converts UTF-16 to UTF-8 before processing data
    # - to be on the safe side we replace \\\\u0000 and \\u0000. It was needed
    #   locally during testing. On a sample production system \\u0000 sufficed,
    #   but doing both should do no harm.
