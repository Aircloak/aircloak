# Deployment

## Overview

All Aircloak-provided components (Insights Air, Insights Cloak, Insights Datasource Connector, and Diffix Explorer) are deployed as
docker containers. As such they can be deployed in physical as well as virtualized environments. They also lend
themselves to be deployed in managed docker environments like Kubernetes and Mesos.

For information on how many instances of the different containers are required for your setup,
please consult the [scaling](/scaling.md) section of this guide.

### Configuration

All Aircloak components have a base set of configuration parameters that are statically configured. For Insights Air
this includes access credentials for its PostgreSQL database. For Insights Cloak it includes information about which
Insights Air instance it should connect to as well as a static configuration for the datasources that should be made
available through it.

The Insights Air and Insights Cloak configurations contain secrets.
The Insights Cloak uses them to secure the communication between itself and Insights Air, while
Insights Air uses secrets for securing the communication with the analyst.

Insights Datasource Connector derives its configuration from that of Insights Cloak.

The static configuration is stored in configuration files made available to the docker containers through
[volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/).

### License file

When running your Insights Air instance for the first time you will need to initialize it with a license file provided
by Aircloak. You can do that in the Aircloak license section of the Admin panel. If you don't have a license file,
please email support at <support@aircloak.com>.

## Resource requirements

### Insights Air

Insights Air has modest resource requirements. It can operate with 512MB of memory, although 1GB of memory is
recommended. For environments where latency is not a concern, it can be deployed on a host performing mixed workloads.
It is generally recommended to give Insights Air access to two or more CPU cores.

### Insights Cloak and Insights Datasource Connector

Insights Cloak and Insights Datasource Connectors are deployed as a single unit. Multiple Insights Cloak instances
should be deployed on separate machines.
During analysis Insights Cloak holds the data being analysed in memory. The memory requirements of Insights Cloak vary
with the size of the dataset being queried. It is recommended to deploy Insights Cloak with a minimum of 8GB of memory.
If queries routinely fail with “out of memory” warnings the amount of memory made available should be increased.

Insights Cloak benefits from having access to multiple CPU cores when multiple queries are to be run in parallel.
