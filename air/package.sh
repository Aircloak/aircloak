# This is a package script meant to be run on the "build server". Its purpose is
# to create most recent images of our services, version them, and push them to the
# docker registry.
#
# Usage: IMAGE_CATEGORY=some_env ./package.sh
# where
#   IMAGE_CATEGORY is arbitrary string which will added as the prefix of the image name.
#   This allows us to maintain different images for different environments (stage, prod).
