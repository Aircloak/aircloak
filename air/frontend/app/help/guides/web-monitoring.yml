  # Monitoring

  Aircloak monitors how our customers use our web platform.
  This is done in order to understand how the product is being
  used, but also in order to better troubleshoot problems
  if they should arise.

  More than most, we understand how unpleasant it can be
  to have a third party monitor what you do.
  We therefore make it easy to disable the monitoring program.
  Disabling the program in no way changes the featureset
  made available to you.
  You can disable the monitoring using the button in
  the left hand menu.

  ## What do we collect

  When monitoring is enabled for your user account,
  we collect the following information:

  - which page on our website you accessed and at what time
  - if the page allows you to perform an action, for example creating or editing a task, we also record whether the action succeeded
