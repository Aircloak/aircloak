# Monitoring

The air component exposes a monitoring endpoint on port 8081. If you want to use it you will have to forward that port
when starting your docker container (as explained in the installation guide). You will also need to generate
a monitoring token for an admin user by going to `/api_tokens` in the web application. Make sure to choose "Monitoring"
from the "Access" dropdown.

After that the endpoint can be accessed at `http://air.endpoint:8081/?auth_token=<your monitoring token>`.

## Data format

The endpoint presents data as the following JSON structure:

<pre class="inlined">
