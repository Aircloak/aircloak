    ## Information collected for the Data Controller

    The following information is recorded by Aircloak Insights:

    ### Personal information
    Your name and email address as part of your user profile as well as other Aircloak Insights
    specific system settings.

    ### Query history
    The queries you execute in Aircloak Insights along with related metadata and the query
    results are recorded. Related metadata includes such things as:

    - the data source the query was run against
    - how long the query took to execute
    - how many columns were requested and how many columns had to be loaded out of the database
    - what query features and capabilities were used (such as function names)

    ### Audit log
    Aircloak Insights provides audit logging capabilities. In addition to the queries being
    executed the audit log records actions such as changing your profile information or logging in to the system.

    For users with administrative privileges, additional information is recorded, namely such actions as
    the creation of user accounts or groups, altering data sources, or changing the general system settings.

    ## Information collected for Aircloak GmbH

    Aircloak GmbH collects pseudonymised statistics about the queries being executed.
    Each analyst is identified by a pseudonym. The pseudonym is an abstract identifier that
    only gives Aircloak GmbH the ability to correlate multiple actions taken by a single individual.
    It does not provide Aircloak GmbH with knowledge of the users name or other personal details.
    For each query the same metadata recorded by Aircloak Insights is also sent to Aircloak GmbH.
    This includes information such as:

    - the data source the query was run against
    - how long the query took to execute
    - how many columns were requested and how many columns had to be loaded out of the database
    - what query features and capabilities were used (such as function names)

    Aircloak GmbH does not record the queries themselves nor the query results.

    The information is analysed through an instance of Aircloak Insights.
    The fully anonymised statistical information of such analyses is subsequently used
    to assess how well different aspects of the system perform and help prioritise future improvements.

    have full insight into the personal information stored about a user.
