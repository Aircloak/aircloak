      <p>Diffix Explorer automatically queries tables in your database through AirCloak. It gathers this anonymized data into clever statistical insights. We'll show you these insights to help you write queries and get actionable information quicker.</p>

      <p>Once Diffix Explorer is set up and has performed its analysis, we'll show you helpful popovers next to your columns. These present information like ranges, averages, histogram or even most frequent days of week. We'll also fabricate sample data so you can get a realistic, yet anonymous sense of what the table looks like.</p>
