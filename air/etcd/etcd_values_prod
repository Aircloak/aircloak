# This is a sample file with values that should
# be stored in etcd when running the rails app
# with docker locally.
#
# To use it, please set the values appropriately,
# and rename it to etcd_values.
#
# It is ignored by git, so you can change values
# at will without leaking local state.
#
# The only primitive supported is:
#
#   etcd_set <path> <value>

set_tcp_ports prod

# Site names
etcd_set /site/aircloak "www.aircloak.com aircloak.com"
etcd_set /site/insights "insights.aircloak.com"

# The database settings are set once when the app launches
# and cannot be changed without relaunching the container.
