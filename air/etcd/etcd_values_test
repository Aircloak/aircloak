# This is a sample file with values that should

#
# To use it, please set the values appropriately,
# and rename it to etcd_values.

# It is ignored by git, so you can change values
# at will without leaking local state.

# The only primitive supported is:
#
#   etcd_set <path> <value>

# Site names
etcd_set /site/aircloak "aircloak.air-local"
etcd_set /site/insights "localhost"

# The database settings are set once when the app launches
# and cannot be changed without relaunching the container.
