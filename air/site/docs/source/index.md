# Introduction

This is the guide for the Aircloak REST APIs. You can use these APIs to perform actions such as executing queries against a cloak cluster, or access results of previous query executions.

All API access is authenticated. Please have a look at the authentication section for details.

The examples in this guide are given in Ruby, wget, and curl. If it is not clear how this applies to your own environment,
please reach out to us on [support@aircloak.com](mailto:support@aircloak.com), and we will be happy to assist.
