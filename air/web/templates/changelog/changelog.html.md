### New features

- Adds an Activity Monitor that allows an administrator to see all queries running in the system across all
  analysts as well as the memory usage across all connected cloaks.
- Show indication of progress when a query is executing.
- Ability to export usage logs rather than have an open connection to Aircloak Central.

### Enhancements

- Allow unlimited recall of past query history
- Produces an error message when a data source is configured with an invalid decryption key
- Adds an endpoint for monitoring by external tools
- Adds a setting pane with the ability to specify the retention time for past queries
- Cloaks terminate queries when about to run out of memory, rather than crash.
- Ability to speed up schema detection of MongoDB collections by sampling a subset of the data.
- Logs produced by the `Cloak`s are sanitized to accidental leakage of sensitive data.
- The performance of computing medians in emulated database queries is improved. In representative use cases by more than a factor of two.
- Improved performance by 30% when using `extract_matches` function.

### Changes

- Remove charting of errors and automatic detection of axes. Instead it's possible to
select which columns to plot.

### Bug fixes
- Fixes usage of dotted names in sub-queries.
