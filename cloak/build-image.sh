# This will build a dockerized version of the cloak.
#
# To reduce the final image size, we build in a few steps:
#
# 1. We start the base Elixir image, and fetch and build the dependencies. The result
#    is stored in the ../docker_cache/cloak folder which is mounted.
# 2. Then we build the release image, where sources as well as deps
#    are copied, and the OTP release is built.
# 3. Finally, we briefly start the release image, fetch the release locally,
#    and create the release container. Here, we just copy the release, without
#    the need to install Erlang.
#
# This approach allows us to cache dependencies locally. Hence, during the build
# we fetch/build only the changed dependencies. The release itself is built in
# the image so we rely on the docker layers caching. If neither sources, nor deps
# have been changed, the existing image will be reused.

# We need the VERSION file to exist inside the container that is used to
# fetch and build the cloak dependencies. Due to how we are mounting a
# variety of distinct folders, we resort to the hacky approach of first
# copying it into the cloak directory and then inside the container
# moving the file from the mounted directory into the container itself.
# This results in the cleanup of the exdtra VERSION file happening as part of the
# dependency building and resolution phase.
