  # Getting started
  Hello <%= current_user.login.capitalize %>.
  To help you get started with the Aircloak analytics system,
  we have a short set of guides that cover the main areas it is benefitial to
  be familiar with.

  ## Please ask for help

  The cloaked analytics system is quite a complex machinery, and we know
  it can be a daunting task to get started. Please do not at
  any point hesitate to reach out to the Airclaok team
  (support@aircloak.com) if you get stuck,
  or want pointers to how certain things can be achieved.


  ## How to read

  The guides cover everything from how you put sensitive data into the system, to how you
  write queries in order to get anonymized results back out.

  I recommend you start by reading the <%= help_link "introduction-uploading-data" %>, and follow
  that up with reading the <%= help_link "introduction-queries" %>.

  Once you have a general understanding of how the different components fit together, you can
  read the more detailed guides as you need them, either for reference, or should you get stuck.
